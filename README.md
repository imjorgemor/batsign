## Features

### Auto Batman Name generator
After introducing yor name in the form will appear at the top of the app your name and a download button.

### Canvas HTML API
The name has been created using the Canvas HTML API. Otherwise is not possible to download elements from the react virtual DOM.

## Roadmap
Generating the name on a canvas HTML element is giving a lot of rendering problems. Next step would be separate the form from the name in different screens but the canvas element does not ge mounted correctly
